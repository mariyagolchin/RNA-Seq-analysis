#  RNA-Seq Analysis
---
In this project, you will learn how to extract a gene expression matrix from FASTQ files and perform advanced analysis on the resulting data. Specifically, you will analyze next-generation sequencing expression profiles of unpaired normal and COVID-19 FFPE bronchoalveolar lavage or lung samples from the study with accession number **GSE190496**.
